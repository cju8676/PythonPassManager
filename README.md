INTRODUCTION
--------------
Since I learned about GUI's in Java at school, I wanted to broaden my knowledge and see if I can create one in Python.
Building off of a YouTube example of a Python GUI, I took some time over the summer to learn some basics on Python GUIs
and SQL to elaborate and create my own project. The project encompasses things I may add as I continue to learn about
them and figure things out.

ABOUT
-------------
The functionality of the GUI includes buttons for adding passwords, deleting passwords, or
searching for passwords in the SQL database. The program utilizes a "database.db" file to save
and view information the user inputs. The GUI displays saved passwords in a chart format
in order of when they added it followed by the service/website, username, and password. 

REQUIREMENTS
---------------
* Python 3.7.1
* PyQt5

INSTALLATION
----------------
The GUI can be downloaded and ran through the IDE of your choice given Python 3.7.1 and PyQt5 modules are installed.
You could also choose to use PyInstaller and make the GUI into an executable/

COMING SOON
--------------
Functionality I hope to have in the future would include:
* Sorting by letter, username, password, service, etc.
* A confirm delete button that ensures the user they truly want to delete their password
from the database.
* Hyperlinks that would allow you to click on the name of the service and it would redirect
you to that services website or app.
* Options to import or export a database of your choice (or perhaps a multiple user type of layout)
